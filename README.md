Jitsuri Trading is an algorithmic trading application that leverages Alpaca for trading in U.S. securities and cryptocurrencies. The application is designed for scalability and allows users to easily add new trading strategies written in Python. The repository includes four trading strategies (opening range breakout, short big tech, long small cap, and news aggregator), as well as notification alerts via SMS and email for executed positions. The user interface utilizes Trading View's charting API to display real-time data without the need for page reloads, and the Lightweight Charting Library provides exceptional usability without sacrificing performance.
